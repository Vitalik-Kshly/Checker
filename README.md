# Checker

A checker for .pas programms(Pascal)
This is a little project for checking programs by tests.
E.G:
We have a program, which does something, also we have a list of input tests and a list of results.
The program would check if all the test results are good. :D
As I was doing this project so far a long time ago, I forgot how to use this program XD.
